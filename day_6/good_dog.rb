#Exercises
#1. In order to create an object, we need to define a class and instantiate it by using the .new method to create an instance.
#2. A module is a collection of behaviors that becomes usable in other classes. We might want to bring in a method for one of our classes, and then also be able to call upon that same method for a different class. Modules allow us to do that.

#module Read
#end

#class HumanBeing
  #include Read
