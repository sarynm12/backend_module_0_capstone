Common Array Methods

**.sort** method - this will return a new array where the elements are sorted. If the elements are strings, they'll come back in alphabetical order. If they're numbers, they'll come back in ascending order value.

**.each** method - calls the given block once for each element. If you want to iterate over an array with .each, you're calling the .each method on that array object.

**.collect** method - invokes the argument block once for each element of the array. A new array is returned, which has the value returned by the block.

**.first** method - returns the first element of the array.

**.last** method - returns the last element of the array.

**.shuffle** method - returns a new array with the elements shuffled.
