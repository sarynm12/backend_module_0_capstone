## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method? Methods essentially give names to a behavior. Suppose the behavior is 'greeting'. With methods, we can sort of create a universal template, where the only thing that changes is the individual's first name. It means we don't have to write a line of code and define a 'greeting' for every name that's out there.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone("name")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I think I'm still having a difficult time coming up with lots of different ways to run a method. I believe I have 5 or 6 that I came up with for the functions_and_variables study skills.
